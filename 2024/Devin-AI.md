# :robot: Cognition-labs Emerges from Stealth to Launch the FIRST AI Software Engineer, Devin
https://www.cognition-labs.com/blog

> Meet Devin, the worldâ€™s first fully autonomous AI software engineer.
> Devin is a tireless, skilled teammate, equally ready to build alongside you or independently complete tasks for you to review.

So basically, the model performs about **8x better than GPT-4 on SWE-bench** (13.86% vs 1.74%), can plan and perform its own actions with **its own code editor + terminals**, and can even search the web for additional documentations when necessary.
It's pretty much stating that in theory Devin can:
  1. Learn New Tech
  2. Test
  3. Deploy
  4. Fix Existing Code
  5. Train its own AI models

Will Devin be just another LLM that promises fake dreams once again? Or will it actually be the "next new thing"?
