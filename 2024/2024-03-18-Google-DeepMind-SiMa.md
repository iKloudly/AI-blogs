# Google DeepMind's SiMA, the master generalist in 3D virtual worlds
https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/

> We present new research on a Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent (SIMA) that can follow natural-language instructions to carry out tasks in a variety of video game settings.

This AI is a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, picking up tasks from navigating mazes to solving puzzles, all without specific training for each task. What's cool is how SiMa learns on the go, getting better over time just like we do, adapting to new challenges with ease. It's a big step toward AI that can understand and interact with complex environments in a more human-like way.
	
* **Versatile Learner**: SiMa can navigate and perform tasks in 3D environments without being specifically trained for each one, showcasing a remarkable level of adaptability and learning efficiency.
* **Sensory Integration**: It processes multiple types of sensory inputs to make decisions, mimicking how humans perceive and interact with the world around them.
* **Continuous Learning**: Unlike many AI systems that require retraining for new tasks, SiMa learns from experience, continuously improving its ability to tackle unfamiliar challenges.
* **Generalist Approach**: SiMa represents a significant move away from specialized AI, demonstrating capabilities across a broad range of tasks within complex, dynamic virtual environments.
